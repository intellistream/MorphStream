### Reproduce all the experiment results

All of our experiments including rawdata and figures can be automatically reproduced by using the following scripts:

```shell
bash run_all.sh
```

You can also run each of the following command to get the rawdata and figures for each individual experiments:

1. Overall system sensitivity study

```shell
bash overview_all.sh
```

2. Workload sensitivity study

```shell
bash sensitivity_study.sh
```

3. Model decision study

```shell
bash model_study.sh
```
