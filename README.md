# MorphStream

![Java CI with Maven](https://github.com/intellistream/MorphStream/workflows/Java%20CI%20with%20Maven/badge.svg?branch=master)

- This project aims at building a scalable transactional stream processing engine on modern hardware. It allows ACID
  transactions to be run directly on streaming data. It shares similar project vision with
  Flink [StreamingLedger](https://www.ververica.com/hubfs/Ververica/Docs/%5B2018-08%5D-dA-Streaming-Ledger-whitepaper.pdf)
  from Data Artisans , but MorphStream emphsizes more on improving system performance leveraging modern multicore
  processors.
- MorphStream is built based on our previous work of TStream (ICDE'20) but with significant changes: the codebase are
  exclusive.
- The code is still under active development and more features will be introduced. We are also actively maintaining the
  project [wiki](https://github.com/intellistream/MorphStream/wiki). Please checkout it for more detailed desciptions.
- We welcome your contributions, if you are interested to contribute to the project, please fork and submit a PR. If you
  have questions, feel free to log an issue or write an email to me: shuhao_zhang AT sutd.edu.sg
